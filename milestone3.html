          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The use of neural networks to predict novel treatments of disease is
            widespread, and includes many areas of medicine and disease.
            Alzheimer's Disease is a  well known disease that impacts the lives of many people. The
            amyloid peptides play a large role in the pathogenesis of the
            disease,largely related to their dysfunction <a
              href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24493463/">[2]</a>. Although
            the Disease impacts such a large population,
            little is known about the underlying biological mechanism as a
            whole, and thus treatments are limited.
            <br><br>
            In 2020, Collins and colleagues <a
              href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420301021?via%3Dihub">[1]</a>
            were able to utilize graph convolutions to produce trainable
            molecular features for use in their neural networks.
            These trainable features were then fed into a feed-forward neural
            network to predict the binary outcome; if the compund
            would act as an antibiotic towards E. coli. This new utilization of
            graph neural networks to train molecular features led to
            the discovery of a novel antibiotic, one that was structurally
            unique to other antibiotics. The proposed project for this course
            involves the reproduction and alteration of Collins work with
            antibiotics to predict novel compounds which may be effective in the treatment of
            Alzheimer's Disease, via interaction with the amyloid peptide. <br><br>

          <p>We decided to work with graphs becuase
            molecular structure resembles a graph such that the atoms are
            represented by nodes and bonds are
            represented by edges.
            The features of a atoms like atom type, and bond type are represented in a matrix
            format. The matrices are stored as node embedding. The drug discovery process requires finding similarity in the structure of the molecule. This is accomplished by message passing functionality. Each node embedding is multiplied by its neighbor node embedding. The number of neighbors a node can gather knowledge is defined in the filters similar to image convolution layers and hence the name graph convolution layers. The functionality of filter multiplication is described in below figure.

           The matrix in the right represent the laplacian of the adjacency matrix. It can be used to create polynomials of the form:
           <img src="laplacian2.png", alt="Graph
            Neural Network" width="300"><br>
            Above polynomial is similar to filter's in CNN's.
            We can make the polynomial of degree 1 and see how the nodes combines it's node embedding with its neighbors as shown below. Increasing the degree will increase the length of edges covered by a node.
            <img src="laplacian3.png", alt="Graph
            Neural Network" width="300"><br>
            The update of node embedding after each iteration is described below.

            As shown in the right figure, h represents the node embedding. It is updated k times which is the number of hidden layers. At each layers, the laplacian polynomials representing the weights of the filters is multiplied with the hidden feature representation to update the node embedding g. A sigmoid functions is then applied to each node embedding to get non-linearity.
            The final output from graph neural network is flatten and passed through a feed forward network for classification.

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <br>
        <h5>Data Collection</h5>
        <p>
          Compound and training data was collected from the PubChem Online
          Database. PubChem comtains chemical information
          for more than 9 billion compounds and the results of thousands of
          experiments performed in labs across the world. For
          this analysis, we used experimental data from PubChem Bioassay 1285
          (INSERT LINK). This assay evaluated 193,771 compounds
          in their ability to inhibit levels of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP).
          Of these 193,771 compounds, we were able to use the
          PubChem compound database to extract relevant chemical information
          (SMILES) for each of the compounds.
          <br><br>
          For the nomination data, chemical information for 10,000 compounds
          were downloaded from the ChembL database,
          another well known chemical library. The purpose of the nomination set
          is to nominate new compounds that have yet to be
          tested in a lab for their ability to reduce levels of the protein. For
          this reason the 10,000 compounds chosen were
          confirmed to not exist in the 193,771 compounds included in the
          training data.
          <br><br>
          <h5>Data Preparation</h5>
          <p>
            DeepChem is a Python library/framework that is often used in the
            Deep Learning and Chemistry fields.
            The framework has integrated many deep learning models and
            functionalities from both PyTorch and TensorFlow.
            Following the extraction of standard chemical data from PubChem,
            graph representations of the molecules were
            needed to pass into our Graph Neural Network models. DeepChem
            provides a function, <i>ConvMolFeaturizer()</i>
            which easily converts approriately formatted graph representations
            by passing in SMILES representations of each
            compound into the function.
            <br><br>
            Due to the nature of drug discovery, the large majority of compounds
            evaluated for activity on proteins
            do not show any activity or impact on levels of the protein. This
            leads to a highly imbalanced dataset.
            In order to account for this, prior to training our models we used
            the DeepChem function <i>BalancingTransformer()</i>
            to minimize the impact of class imbalance on classification tasks.
            The <i>BalancingTransformer</i> function
            accomplishes this by balancing the class weights of both classes, to
            ensure similar impact on model training from
            both classes.
            <br><br>
            The data was split into training, validation, and test sets in a
            80:10:10 ratio. Only 0.89% of tested compounds
            showed activity against the Amyloid Precursor Protein, thus we split
            the data using the <i>RandomStratifiedSplitter()</i>
            function within DeepChem. This ensured the training, validation, and
            test set had equally proportional data in terms of
            class balance.
            <br><br>
            <h6><b>Data preparation for Support Vector Machine and Feed Forward Network</b></h6>
            <p>Simple feed forward network requires input in the format of a matrix. So we have used API from RDKIT library. It takes as input a SMILES string and provides an object of molecular structure. The object is transformed into vector format by method rdMolDescriptors.GetMorganFingerprintAsBitVect of rdkit library. This ouptut is called morgan fingerprint. </p>
            <p>Contrary to this, graph neural network works with one hot encoding matrices of atom type, bond type and features like chirality, electrical charge of molecules. An example of a node object is Data(x=[25, 79], edge_index=[2, 54], edge_attr=[54, 10], y=[1]). Here x is the node index, edge index and edge attribute are edge index, and y is 1, if the compound can inhibit the progress of protein. Below figure represents molecular object, its finger print representation, adjacency matrix and feature matrices.

            <br><br>
            <h5>Model Training</h5>
            The GraphConvModel provided by DeepChem was used as the baseline
            Graph Neural Network model for our analyses. From this model
            we tuned the parameters to determine which architecture provided the
            best performance on our validation set. The architecture
            of the final model included: <br><br>

        <ul>
          <li> Model building : The current model implemented in our project
            is the out-of-the-box model provided by DeepChem. We would like to
            use our current results to
            build off of this model and create custom layers and parameters.
          </li>
          <li> Experiment and performance comparison(In progress): We will use
            support vector machine as an alternative model. It takes Morgan
            fingerprint as an input \
            and performs classification. We will then do comparison of the
            performance of neural network model and SVM. If time permits we
            will try to build random forest model and compare its performance
            with feed-forward neural network model
          </li>
        </ul>
