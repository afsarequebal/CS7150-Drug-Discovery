<h3>Related Work</h3>

<p>
Historically, neural networks in drug discovery used the fixed chemical properties of
molecules as feature input into neural networks. These networks could then predict
the efficacy/activity of a suggested compound given its chemical properties. <br><br>

In 2020, Collins and colleagues <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420301021?via%3Dihub">[1]</a>
were able to utilize graph convolutions to produce trainable molecular features for use in their neural networks.
These trainable features were then fed into a feed-forward neural network to predict the binary outcome; if the compund
would act as an antibiotic towards E. coli. This new utilization of graph neural networks to train molecular features led to
the discovery of a novel antibiotic, one that was structurally unique to other antibiotics. <br><br>

The use of neural networks to predict novel treatments of disease is widespread, and includes many areas of medicine and disease. Alzheimer's Disease is a
well known disease that impacts the lives of many people. The amyloid peptides play a large role in the pathogenesis of the disease,
largely related to their dysfunction <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24493463/">[2]</a>. Although the Disease impacts such a large population,
little is known about the underlying biological mechanism as a whole, and thus treatments are limited.


<h3>Proposal</h3>

The proposed project for this course involves the reproduction and alteration of Collins work with antibiotics to predict
novel compounds which may be effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, via interaction with the amyloid peptide. This would
include the use of the open source code in the Chemprop library <a href="https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop">[3]</a>. The open source
code would give us a solid foundation to build on this project and allow us to experiment with and make modifications to the model.
<br><br>

 Pubchem is a well-known source for chemical
and drug-related information. One element of the database is the experimental data of biological compounds and their effect on biological
targets of interest. In our proposal, we aim to use the experimental data from Pubchem on which compounds display bioactivity against the Amyloid
peptide implicated in Alzheimer's Disease. This bioassay database provides experimental data for nearly 200,000 compounds and their activity /
impact on the Amyloid peptide <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/1276">[4]</a>. By using this data, we can incorporate a network to predict the binary classification outcome comparable to Collins
used above, however aimed to predict the bioactivity against the Amyloid peptide.

<h3>Milestone 2</h3>   
<h4>Main Method implemented implemented/reproduced</h4>                                                                                   
<img src="gnnArchitecture.png" alt="Graph Neural Network" width="500" height="500"><br>                                                                                     
Molecule can be easily represented as a graph where each node represent an atom type and each edge represent bond type.<br>
Each molecule is represented using three matrices<br>
1) Adjacency Matrix : Here each row and column represent an atom. It marks a cell as one if there is an edge between two nodes.<br>
2) Atom feature matrix : Here row represents an atom and column represent atom features like atom type, number of neutrons.<br>
3) Edge feature matrix : Here each row represents an atom and column represent bond type. For example single and double bond.<br>
<br>
Our task is predict whether a molecule is drug or not for which we can use a fully connected network.<br> 
If we pass atom feature and edge feature directly to the neural network, the network will not utilise the connection between atoms. 
To overcome this, graph neural network helps to create node embedding which retains information about atom features, and connected atom features.<br>
<br>
The three sub-structures in the above diagrams is described below:<br>
1) Graph convolution layer : It uses below function to convert atom features into node embedding.<br>
<img src="messageFunction.png" alt="Graph Neural Network" width="200" height="60"><br> 
Here h is a fuction representing the state of an atom i at timestamp t. The Message function takes as input state of an atom, the state of neighboring atoms and its atom features. <br>
<br>
It applies three fuctions to the input<br>
 &emsp; a) Transform : It is matrix multiplication of adjacency matrix and edge matrix. <br>
 &emsp; b) Aggregate : It is normalization of transformed matrix. <br>
 &emsp; c) Update : In this the aggregated input and atom feature itself is passed through neural network to create node embedding.  <br>
<br>
2) Global sum pooling layer: The node embedding created in GNN is not useful becuase each node have different size. So, in this layer, mean/sum of all the columns are taken and a new embedding is created with equal size by adding zero padding <br>
<br>
3) Fully connected layer: The node embedding created in global sum pooling layer is now passed through a fully connected layer, that predicts whether a molecule is a drug.

<br>
<br>
<h4>Implementation details</h4>
Hyperparameters:<br>
&emsp;1) Input size : There are 193158 molecules and divided into 60% training data, 20% test data and 20% validation data.<br>
&emsp;2) Weight Decay : Weight decay as 0. It can vary from 0.001 to 0.01.<br>
&emsp;3) Dropout : It is initialized as 0.<br> 
&emsp;4) Node embedding size: The node embedding features are initialized as 128 and can increase upto 256.<br>
&emsp;5) Message passing layer: There are two message passing layers. It can vary from 2-5.<br>
&emsp;6) Network/Architecture size: There are two graph convolution layers and two fully connected layers. Both graph and full connected layers can vary &emsp; &emsp;from 2-5 layers.<br>
<br>
<h4>Implementation plans</h4>

Step 1) Download molecules data from <p style="color:blue;font-size:18px;"> <a href = "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/1285">"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/1285"</a><p>
<br>
Step 2) Data prepocessing : Perform exploratory data analysis to convert molecules represented in a smiles string to a graph representation.
<br>
Step 3) Model building : Use the Deep chem libraries to for training the model and customize hyperparameters.
<br>
Step 4) Training and model evaluation: We will generate accuracy, AUC, ROC curve to evaluate its performance.
<br>
Step 5) Compare the performance of graph neural network against Support vector machine.
